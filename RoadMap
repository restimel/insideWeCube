V1.2
	Build Cube
	✓ Change start/Finish position
	✓ Consider Pin on level that block the ball
		✓ simple movement with Pin
		✓ consider pin that blocks below level to be build (no right wall for the cell bellow)
	✓ Block level7 at level7
	✓ Do not propose other levels at level7
		✓ add an option to deactivate it
	✓ create an advanced tool for different options
		✓ level7
		✓ blockers cell
		✓ cell tools
			✓ hole (default)
			✓ Start/Finish
			✓ pin
	✓ add comments to levels
	✓ give small map with different orientation (other than top/bottom like stickers)
		✓ add an option to watch/hide them
		✓ display them in print mode

	Path
	✓ Change algorithm to something like try all moves and see which is the shortest (done when ball is lost)
		→ should fix:
			There are still issues if ball reach another valid path
			Some hard passages

→	Auto-Generator
	✓ create interface to choose levels and options
		✓ select levels
		+ change start position
		+ allow to rotate levels
		✓ manage pin for levels selector
	✓ compute levels to test solvabale cubes
	✓ create interface to display solvable cubes
		✓ select cubes user like and save them
		✓ identify cubes that are already in database

V1.3
	General
	* Support cubes with not normal size
		* Allow to create cube with not normal size
	+ accept key shortcut (see how to manage them through menu)
	+ Minification: do a minify version

	Build Cube
	✓ See phantom ball
	✓ Defines phantom in cubes
	+ auto-save to draft
		→ FAQ: What is draft cube
	* key Shortcut (Ctrl+S / Ctrl+z)
	+ Add not accessible cell for advanced tool

	Cube analyzer
	* allow to find moves with a phantom ball

	Auto-Generator
	upgrade interface to choose levels and options
		+ change start position
		+ allow to rotate levels
	* manage level by level
		* add an interface to tell wich level are allowed on each level
	* add a filter to find good levels only which match the filter
	* Display previous result when coming back to cubeGenerator
	+ interact with manage cube to edit it
	+ Performance
		+ improve speed execution
		+ improve memory consumption
			→ hash usage
		+ improve DOM consumption
			→ limit results
			→ Infinite scroll

/!\ Bugs
	General
	* translation is not done for compatibility check message

	About
	* Dates are always in English

	Analyze Cube
	+ Skinning of the instructions to the way back

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V2.0 (or later... if enough motivation)

	Build cube
	? switch level (need idea about design)

	Analyze Cube
	✗ (bonus, if I really want) identify in which cube we are if no positions match

	Cube3D
	✗ (I don't think I'll do it) fallback rendering for Browser which doesn't support RotateX
