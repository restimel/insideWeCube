V1.1
	General
		✓ Save Language in localStorage
		✓ warning message when browser is not compatible
		✓ select which cube to export
		✓ save Cubes built in a indexedDb
			✓ allow to remove cube from DBStorage
			* auto-save to draft
			* FAQ 	✓ how to remove cubes
					→ What is draft cube

	Build Cube
		✓ change Cube color
		* key Shortcut (Ctrl+S / Ctrl+z)
		✓ filter on cube
		✓ display small format map (and with reverse side)
			✓ pop-up
			✓ change map color
			✓ change orientation
			✓ show/hide mini-map
		✓ do something (not log ?) when unexpected movement happens when rotated localy

	Analyze Cube
		✓ give sign instruction (in position)
			✓ give sumary of instructions
		✓ give better help on impossible help (direct movement or position (display a 4th column with level position))
			✓ give new position of the cube
		✓ give position of possible cells in mini-map

 /!\ Bugs
		Build Cube
		✓ When modifying an original cube the new values are overwritten by the original cube at reload
		✓ There are no messages of deletion success
		✓ There are no confirmation before deletion
		✓ The analysis is not re-run when cube is already loaded

		Paths
		✓ Do not found correct rotations  for some passage (Awful)
				-→------?  -→-------?
				   ↓  |	      |   ↓
		✗ There are still issues if ball reach another valid path

		Analyze Cube
		✗ Skinning of the instructions to the way back
			✓ auto-focus
		✓ position and movement instruction are not sync (see Awful)
			✓ compute new orientation on hard passage
			✓ sometime a hard passage is detected when moving back (cf vicious on way back)
			✓ warning movement is triggered in Awful due to wrong repositionnement after hard passage

		General
		✓ use a custom font to avoid issue with missing characters

V1.2
	General
	* Prepare cubes with not normal size
	* Allow to create cube with not normal size
	
	Paths
	* Change algorithm to something like try all moves and see which is the shortest
		→ should fix:
			There are still issues if ball reach another valid path
			Some hard passages
	
	Build Cube
	* Change start/Finish position
	* Consider blocker on level that block the ball
	* Block level7 at level7
	* Do not propose other levels at level7 (on option it should be proposed)
	* create an advanced tool for different options
		* level7
		* blockers cell
		* cell tools
			* hole (default)
			* Start/Finish
			* blockers
			* Not accessible cell
	* add comments to levels
	* switch level (need idea about design)
	+ give small map with different orientation (other than top/bottom like stickers)

→	Auto-Generator
	* create interface to choose levels and options
	* compute levels to test solvabale cubes
	* create interface to display solvable cubes
		* select cubes user like and save them
	+ interact with manage cube to edit it

	Analyze Cube
	✗ (bonus, if I really want) identify in which cube we are if no positions match

	Cube3D
	✗ (I don't think I'll do it) fallback rendering for Browser which doesn't support RotateX

/!\ Bugs
	Analyze Cube
	+ Skinning of the instructions to the way back
