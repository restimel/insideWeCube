* main page
* translate words
	* Make a tool script to parse sentences
* Add change language button
* select which cube to export
* Message could disappears after an defined amount of time

Build Cube
X Analyze feasiblity of cube during constrution
	X display information (cube feasability, difficulty)
		X calculate number of move
			→ do something (not log ?) when unexpected movement happens when rotated localy
			X repeat movement to find way back
			X move the ball accordingly to the way back
		X calculate difficulty
			X count rotations bottom/up
* display small format map (and with reverse side)
→ (bonus): give small map with different orientation

Cube Solver
* Add interaction to find place
	* Render
		* allow to change cube position at start
		X Communication between BallLocater and worker to ask questions
		X display instruction at the correct place
		X send Results
		X display correct position
			→ display image
		X Communication between BallLocater and Analyzer to go to step 3
		* Step3: display result
			* find the movements list
			* give path to find start
				→ (+ end?)
			X display instructions
		→ Nice to have: an answer 'I am not sure what happens'
	* BallLocater
		* Reset (ball lost → restart)
	→ (bonus) identify in which cube we are
* Add interaction with cube to find place
	* make a form to give cube position

Skinning
* Helper for direction
* cube solver
* pictures: http://game-icons.net/

Bugs
* Heuristic: Duplicate cells in movement blocks to find only one cell
→ Do not found correct rotations  for some passage (Awful)
