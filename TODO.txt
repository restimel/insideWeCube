→ Analyze feasiblity of cube during constrution
	* display information (cube feasability, difficulty)
		→ calculate number of move (→ In progress)
			→ do something (not log ?) when unexpected movement happens when rotated localy
			X repeat movement to find way back
			X move the ball accordingly to the way back
		X calculate difficulty
			X count rotations bottom/up
* display small format map (and with reverse side)
→ (bonus): give small map with different orientation

Cube Solver
X Select a cube
* Add interaction to find place
	* Render
		* allow to change cube position at start
		X Communication between BallLocater and worker to ask questions
		X display instruction at the correct place
		X send Results
		X display correct position
			→ display image
		* Communication between BallLocater and Analyzer to go to step 3
		* Step3: display result
		→ Nice to have: an answer 'I am not sure what happens'
	* BallLocater
		* Reset (ball lost → restart)
	→ (bonus) identify in which cube we are
* give path to find start (+ end?)
